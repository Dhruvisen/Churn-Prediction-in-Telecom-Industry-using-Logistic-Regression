# project 1: Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industry-using-Logistic-Regression
Approach:
We have performed data preprocessing, Missing Value Analysis, Feature Engineering, identified most valuable customers, tagged churners, and performed required EDA. We have mentioned few inferences observed during EDA.
As part of data preparation, we have split the data into train-test dataset and performed SMOTE on training dataset to handle class imbalance. 
We have used Logistic Regression model on actual features.
