# project 1: Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industry-using-Logistic-Regression
Approach:
I have performed data preprocessing, Missing Value Analysis, Feature Engineering, identified most valuable customers, tagged churners, and performed required EDA. I have mentioned few inferences observed during EDA.
As part of data preparation, I have split the data into train-test dataset and performed SMOTE on training dataset to handle class imbalance. 
I have used Logistic Regression model on actual features.
